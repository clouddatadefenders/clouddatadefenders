# E-Commerce Website on AWS

This repository contains the files and documentation for our project, an e-commerce website hosted on AWS. Our team used AWS S3 for static website hosting and Route 53 to configure a custom domain name.

## Project Overview

This project involved setting up a fully functional, static e-commerce website hosted on AWS infrastructure. Our primary objectives were:
- To host the website files on AWS S3, allowing for scalable and secure static content delivery.
- To manage and route our custom domain using AWS Route 53 for improved performance and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **AWS S3**: Used to store and serve the website's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **AWS Route 53**: Configured for domain name management and DNS routing.

## Getting Started

To view and interact with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Accessing the Hosted Website:

The website is hosted on an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
Use the custom domain set up through Route 53 to access the live website.
Domain Configuration:

We used Route 53 to purchase/manage the domain and set up DNS records.
The S3 bucket is linked to the domain, and HTTPS is enabled using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for secure access.
Deployment
Hosting on S3
Upload Files: Files are uploaded to an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting.
Permissions: S3 bucket permissions are set to allow public read access for all files.
Access Control: Policies are defined to ensure secure access to assets.
Domain Setup in Route 53
DNS Records: Route 53 is configured with an A record pointing to the S3 bucket’s website endpoint.
HTTPS Configuration: SSL/TLS certificates are issued through AWS Certificate Manager for secure, HTTPS access.
